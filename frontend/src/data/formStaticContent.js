  "Extraction Consent": `
Extraction(s) are to be performed on the tooth/teeth listed above. While we expect no complications, there are some risks involved with this procedure. The more common complications are:

- Pain, infection, swelling, bruising, and discoloration. Adjacent teeth may be chipped or damaged during the extraction.

- Nerves that run near the area of extraction may be bruised or damaged. You may experience some temporary numbness and tingling of the lip and chin, or in rare cases, the tongue. In some extremely rare instances, the lack of sensation could be permanent.

- In the upper arch, sinus complications can occur because the roots of some upper teeth extend near or into the sinuses. After extraction, a hole may be present between the sinus and the mouth. If this happens, you will be informed and the area repaired.

By signing below you acknowledge that you understand the information presented, have had all your questions answered satisfactorily, and give consent to perform this procedure.

  "Denture/Partial Repair Consent": `
I understand that the repair that is being done to my existing Partial denture today and can not be guaranteed due to missing teeth in the existing dentition and due to the age of the existing prosthesis. This repair may or may not be temporary.

If I am having a relign or rebase of an old Denture or Partial I understand that Today’s Dentistry is not responsible for changes in the fit of the original appliance. The prosthesis may or may NOT fit as the original did years ago or when I originally had it made. The reason is that over time, the patient’s bone shrinks or deteriorates and a rebase or relign is a secondary option to dental implants or a new prosthesis with soft tissue management.

We will do our best to make the patient comfortable but sometimes there are limitations due to bone shrinkage and the soft tissue that lacks bone support. Therefore, after the relign or rebase the patient will be entitled to two free adjustments within a month period. After this the patient will have to pay for any and all adjustments.
`,

"Implant Consent": `
There are no instances, which has been reported in the dental literature in which dental implants have ever been reported as being the cause of cancer.

HOW IS AN IMPLANT INSERTED?
Although there are many types of implants, the types can be divided into two basic groups -- those that are inserted in the bone, and those that are placed over the bone. In both instances, the implants are placed under the tissue, and extend through the tissue into the mouth. Most implants require soft tissue grafting to improve the prognosis of the implants.

DECISIONS AND LENGTH OF TREATMENT TIME
If you have decided that you want to be considered as an implant candidate, and you feel that psychologically it will be no emotional problem for you to have implants, then you can be encouraged from the fact that there are many people in this country and throughout the world who have had hip transplants, pins placed in the hips, kidney and heart transplants, and cornea transplants with excellent results. If you do not feel that you have adequate emotional stability to undergo similar treatment, then I would advise you against having an implant. Implant treatment in some cases can be a lengthy process. It may involve Bone Grafting in which the bone must knit or grow for four to nine months and occasionally longer. After your doctor has determined that the bone is ready for implant placement, it will take six to nine months to become firmly attached to the bone before fixed teeth can be attached to the implants.

GUARANTEE
There is no way that we can guarantee anything which goes into the mouth, and which is under the control of the patient. The physician does not tell you that the transplanted heart, the kidney transplant, or the coronary by-pass will keep you alive for any specified period of time. We can only tell you that we will endeavor to place the implant properly, will give you the information you need to help care for your implant at home, and will be available for regular periodic check-up appointments to evaluate your continued dental health.
We will do everything we can to make the implant succeed, but you will have to make the same commitment. If you do not hold up your end of the bargain, the implant will most likely fail. Also, you must return to our office at regular intervals according to our recommendations for examination and service.
If you do not do this, you could get into difficulty without your knowing it. This could result in the loss of the implant. Under such circumstances, the fault would be yours. Due to the complex nature of Oral Implantology, it is important that this office handle all postoperative examinations and/or treatment. Referrals will be made only to those doctors with experience and training in implant dentistry.

COSMETIC SURGERY
Are dental implants inserted for cosmetics reasons? Absolutely not! The primary objective of dental implants is to give additional support to the replacement teeth.

Dental Implantology is not a total substitute for facelift plastic surgery. Some cosmetic enhancement is possible, however, and those expectations should be fully discussed prior to treatment.

COMPLICATIONS - Some patients have little or no problems at all. Some have bruising, swelling and discomfort.

FURTHER QUESTIONS
If you have any questions, which have not been fully answered by this monograph, please feel free to ask them prior to beginning treatment. We will do our best to inform you.

"Filling Consent": `
A thin, white, sticky film called plaque causes tooth decay.  Plaque constantly accumulates on your teeth and contains harmful bacteria.  When the plaque is combined with sugars from the foods we eat, it forms an acid.  The decay process begins when this acid attacks the tooth enamel (1).  If the decay is not treated early, the cavity will rapidly progress toward the pulp (2) in the central part of the tooth.  Discomfort may result because the pulp contains the nerve of the tooth.  If the decay continues into the pulp, infection may set in.

X-rays are used to detect hidden areas of tooth decay and possible decay between your teeth.  To repair the decayed teeth, your dentist will clean out the decayed area and fill it with filling material (3).  The proper and most inexpensive approach to tooth decay is its prevention, early detection and treatment.

X-rays are two-dimensional and sometimes do not show the full extent of the decay present.  Sometimes, it is not known until the dentist removes the decay how far into the dentin the decay traveled and if it has entered the nerve canal.  Also, sometimes after a filling has been done, if the decay is close to the nerve the tooth may be sensitive for several weeks.  Most of the time the sensitivity subsides, however, in some instances filled teeth may require root canal therapy. Also, if the filling falls out due to the patient having a collapsed bite, it is not considered under warranty, and the patient is responsible for the full cost of redoing the filling. If insurance paid for the original filling and it fails due to collapsed bite, patient is responsible for 100% of the cost of redoing it, as insurance will not pay for it again.
`,

"Crown/Bridge Consent": `
1. I understand that the first appointment is for preparing the crown of the tooth to the proper shape and size for the permanent crown. I understand that the tooth will be covered with a temporary crown for at least three to four weeks during the time that the dental laboratory is fabricating the permanent crown.

2. I understand that I am responsible for making sure that I come in immediately if the temporary crown comes off or breaks during this three to four week period. I understand that the teeth can shift in a very short period of time (sometimes overnight) and that if the temporary comes out, that the permanent crown or crowns/bridges may not fit and may need to be remade by the dental lab, in which I would be responsible for partial or full cost replacement crown.

3. I understand that coming in for the permanent seat of the permanent crown is necessary within a three to four week period and that if I cannot keep my appointment for the permanent seat, that I could be responsible for the full payment of another crown if I do not keep my follow-up seat appointment.

4. In addition, I understand that the permanent crown is sometimes seated with temporary cement so that the patient can see if the fit is going comfortable and pain free. I am responsible for keeping my appointment for the permanent cementation and that if I do not keep this appointment, I am responsible for the cost of tooth repair at a later time.

5. I understand that front teeth MAY have a custom shading charge if I am not happy with the shade, as front teeth are extremely hard to match exactly. Each appointment for custom shading will be charged until the patient and Doctor are happy. (Insurance does not cover this as this is considered cosmetic.)

6. I understand that crown and bridge is a biological procedure and there is no guarantee that capping a tooth will prevent the patient from future pain, tooth repair or loss. Capping a tooth most often protects the tooth after a root canal from cracking and in addition, most often helps in providing a protective barrier when the tooth structure is damaged or cracked. However, I understand that nerve tissue is involved and that the nerve is sometimes hypersensitive to hot and/or cold and percussion, and that sometimes a tooth is irreparable after crown preparation procedures. I understand that in some cases a root canal may still be needed AFTER crown preparation procedure. I understand that placement of a crown is an attempt at fixing tooth structure but that if the tooth cannot be saved after placement of a crown, I am still responsible for full payment of the crown and bridge. I understand that once a tooth is prepared for a crown and an impression is sent to the lab, this crown is custom made for me and there will be no refund after acceptance of the consent and after impression is made even if the crown is not seated. I also understand that if I am missing any teeth, this is considered a "Collapsed Bite" and this could potentially affect the longevity of the crown. The molars, or implants in the molar's place, are the support system needed to sustain long term restoration.

7. I have requested Today's Dentistry to place crown and bridge on my teeth/tooth I understand that if I have dental insurance, Crown Lengthening (Gingivectomy) is at most times NOT covered by insurance. I understand that the Dentist has determined that the decay is below the gum-line or at bone level therefore, tissue must be removed using a dental laser, electrosurge or surgical bur, in order to expose healthy tooth structure and provide the best possible crown margin.

8. I understand that if I am using dental insurance, sometimes my insurance may pay less on a crown due to clauses in my policy and I am responsible for the difference.

9. I understand that sometimes insurance may need additional time processing the claim even if the crown is ready to be seated and I may be called and offered the option of rescheduling my crown seat until insurance pays or I may pay the account balance, have the crown seated, and be refunded once insurance pays. BUT, I also understand that if I choose to wait and the temporary comes off, I am responsible if the remaining tooth structure is damaged by my decision to wait.
`,

  "Apicoectomy Consent":
`I understand dentistry is not an exact science and there is no guarantee of results. When undergoing an Apicoectomy there are certain risks and the potential for unsuccessful results. An Apicoectomy is a common endodontic treatment which is necessitated in the rare instance there is inflammation or infection at the tip of the root subsequent to root canal therapy. An incision is made in the gum tissue near the affected tooth and the inflamed or infected tissue is removed and the area filled and sealed. The gum is then sutured with small stitches. Additional tests may be performed on the infected/inflamed tissue which was removed.

The benefit of an Apicoectomy will be relief of current symptoms and avoiding the spread of infection to other teeth, damaging oral health.

Alternatives to an Apicoectomy depend on the diagnosis; however, the most common alternatives are:
• Extraction of the tooth/teeth;
• Extraction followed by an implant and crown;
• Extraction followed by a bridge or partial denture;
• No treatment, which could worsen the condition leading to severe pain and swelling, infection which could be fatal, and/or loss of the tooth/teeth.

An Apicoectomy, like all dental care, has risks. The most common risks associated with this treatment include but are not limited to:
• Swelling, bruising and discomfort postoperatively
• Bleeding and postoperative infection accompanied by malaise or fever which may require immediate additional treatment
• Injury to a nerve resulting in numbness, burning or tingling of the chin, lip, cheek, or gum on the side the procedure is being performed, as well as loss of taste in the tongue; these nerve injuries can last for several weeks, months or be permanent
• Drug and medication reactions (e.g., redness, pain, vomiting, anaphylactic shock)
• Sinus involvement which may require additional surgery
• Gum recession exposing more of the tooth/root

Prior to surgery, an antibiotic or anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed. Note: antibiotics may interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use alternate birth control for one full cycle post-antibiotics.

Additional appointments may be required after surgery to monitor healing.

By signing below, I confirm I have read or had this document read to me, have asked any questions and received answers. I understand the potential risks and have chosen to proceed with treatment having considered alternatives.
`,

  "Bone Graft  Consent": `
The Purpose of the procedure - After teeth have been removed, the supporting bone around the teeth slowly dissolves away. This also occurs when prolonged gum problems have been present. The result is insufficient bone to support implants. Bone may be grown allowing implants to be placed later. Specially treated bone from a human bone bank may be placed in the area where bone is deficient. We will be using Bone from Human Cadaver mixed with the patient’s own bone Segment and for the soft tissue deficiency we will be using the palatal tissue for the bone graft coverage.

Implant Placement. The added bone is left to mature before implants are placed. Depending on the amount of bone being grown implants may be placed after four to nine months. Occasionally it may be necessary to wait a little longer.

The Final Restorative Procedures. Implants are left to become firmly attached to bone for three to nine months before a denture or crown and bridgework is fitted to them.

Immediate Post-operative Effects. Some patients have little or no problem at all. Some have bruising, swelling, infection, discomfort. It is not possible to predict who has what after effects. In lower grating procedures there is a risk of lip numbness. This usually recovers in a few weeks but may last several months. In very rare cases it is permanent.
I have read and understand the above statement.

Later Complications. Infection and loss of the graft is possible but the incidence is low. Other complications include infection, swelling, pain, bleeding, and non-healing of the tissue grafted site.

Timing. Avoid special business or social function for about ten days. In the event that the procedure is unsuccessful it may be necessary to repeat the procedure and that there would be no charge for the time spent. However you will be required to pay the cost of any materials used and for a possible sedation fee.
I have read and understand the above statement.

I have read and understood this consent form and understand that my treatment may be videotaped and photographed and have been given a copy to take home.
`,

"Build-Up Consent": `
A build-up is a large filling in which we replace the entire crown structure of the tooth. This is necessary due to decay, fracture, or when a root canal has been done prior. It is always necessary to protect the rebuilt coronal structure with a custom fabricated crown. Sometimes, due to financial constraint the patient opts to wait to have the protected crown made. Although normally, a build-up can last thirty to ninety days before having the final crown made, we cannot guarantee that this large filling will not fracture before this time period. The purpose of this consent is to inform you that the optimal treatment is protection with a cap. If this is not done, the build-up could fracture, resulting in additional fracture remaining tooth structure.
`,

"Coronectomy Consent": `
A coronectomy or partial Odontectomy is a procedure used to remove a tooth that has not yet broken through the surface of the gum but has a increased chance of injuring the nerve that provides feeling of the lower lip and chin. The procedure is done by moving the gum away from the tooth and then cutting the crown (top) of the teeth. It is done in such a way so that the surrounding bone will "fill in" the space that was occupied by the crown of the tooth. The roots of the tooth are left in place so that the risk of injuring the nerve that gives the feeling to the lower lip and chin are reduced.

**Risks**

There are some risks/complications which include:
1. Please see the risks associated with Local Anesthesia
2. Please see the risks associated with Molar Tooth Extraction
3. There is still risk of injury to the nerve that supplies feeling to the teeth, gums, lower lip, chin and tongue where the procedure is done. In most cases the altered sensation is temporary but in rare cases can be permanent.
4. Risk of infection requiring additional treatment.
5. Risk of development of a cyst or other growth around the tooth root that might need more treatment.
6. Movement of the root is possible over a period of years. In most cases if the root moves, it usually moves away from the nerve.
7. You should get x-rays over a period of several years to look at the area and determine how the bone is filling in the area.
8. In some cases, if the root fragment becomes loose during the surgery, we might have to take out the entire tooth. Most of the time we can tell from x-rays taken prior to the procedure, but we need to make that decision during the course of the procedure.
9. If my dentist finds a different condition than expected and feels that a different surgery or more surgery needs to be done, I agree to have it done.
10. Patients should assume that there will always be pain and/or discomfort and/or swelling and/or bruising. The duration will sometimes be 2 weeks or more.
11. Infection of the extraction socket (dry socket). This may cause pain and discomfort but is easily managed by the dentist.
12. Biting of the numb lip which may cause damage after the teeth have been removed. Children should be watched closely by parent/guardian until the numbness wears off.
13. Damage to the inferior dental nerve on each side of the mandible (lower jaw). This nerve passes very close to the root of the lower wisdom tooth and gives feeling to the lower teeth, lower lip and chin on the affected side. There is a slight risk of some damage to the nerve. This may cause numbness that may be temporary (6–12 months) or permanent.
14. Damage to the inferior lingual nerve of each side of the mandible. This nerve passes very close to the root of the lower wisdom tooth and gives feeling to the tongue and floor of mouth. Damage may cause numbness that may be temporary or permanent.
15. The tooth root tip may break off in small pieces when the tooth is taken out. The dentist may not remove those pieces if removal poses risk to nerves or other structures.
16. Damage to teeth growing tightly against the wisdom tooth during removal.
17. Damage to fillings or other restorations including crowns in adjacent teeth.
18. Weakness of the jaw due to removal of the wisdom teeth. The jaw may break during the procedure or healing.
19. There will be some pain and swelling. This may be moderate or severe and could require pain killers.
20. Bleeding of the socket is expected. This is usually minor and easily controlled by applying pressure.

I have read this consent form in full and understand what it says. I was able to ask questions and raise concerns with the dentist about my condition, the procedure and its risks, and my treatment options, as well as the option to delay or decline treatment. My questions and concerns have been answered to my complete satisfaction.
`,

"Crown Lengthening Consent": `
I have requested the provider to place crown and bridge on my teeth/tooth. I understand that if I have dental insurance, crown lengthening is NOT a covered benefit by most insurance plans.

I understand that the dentist has determined the decay is below the gum-line or at the bone level, and therefore tissue must be removed using a dental laser or handpiece in order to expose healthy tooth structure and provide the best possible crown margin.

It is possible that when removing tissue, some inflammation could occur and/or the possibility of prolonged sensitivity. To help reduce sensitivity, we recommend warm salt water rinses for the next 3 days.
`,
"Essix Retainer": `
I understand that the prosthesis I am receiving is not the permanent prosthesis. I UNDERSTAND IT IS ONLY USED IN TEMPORARY SITUATIONS AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE FIT OR LONGEVITY OF THE APPLIANCE. It has been explained to me that the normal replacement for missing teeth is either a fixed bridge, dental implants or a permanent removable partial denture.

I understand that an essix is only constructed as a temporary appliance and does not have clasps or a metal base like a removable partial and will not have the retention of a permanent prosthesis.

I UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT APPLIANCE AND MAY NOT BE USED FOR EATING/CHEWING. This appliance is to be taken out when eating or it may break. The purpose of this appliance is to give a patient the appearance of teeth while healing after extractions/dental implants or while a permanent appliance is being made.

I understand that if the temporary appliance breaks for any reason, that I will have to pay to replace it.

"Flipper Consent": `I understand that the prosthesis I am receiving is not a permanent prosthesis. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS ONLY USED IN TEMPORARY SITUATIONS AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE FIT OR LONGEVITY OF THE APPLIANCE.

I understand that if the temporary appliance breaks for any reason, that I will have to pay to replace it.

Insurance does not pay for a temporary cosmetic appliance such as this and therefore, payment will be due upon impression date.`,

"Immidiate Denture Consent": `I request the provider to make an immediate denture to replace missing teeth for me.

I understand that whenever natural teeth are lost due to decay, disease, or an accident the bone that surrounds the lost teeth deteriorates. This makes it difficult for the dentist to properly fit partials or dentures.

An immediate denture is different from a regular delivery in that an immediate is delivered the day the teeth are extracted (or within a few weeks). A regular denture delivery is done usually after the bone has already recontoured or reshaped from the extracted teeth. After the denture is originally delivered the denture will usually require a reline after 6 months to 1 year. This reline will usually incur an additional cost from the denture fee. During the first six months after the denture is delivered, I may call as often as needed for an adjustment. However, I understand that any relines that are required, after the six month period, will be charged to me at the full reline price. I also understand that due to the unpredictability of bone loss a perfect fit may not be possible, despite the dentist’s efforts.

I acknowledge responsibility for the payment of such services and agree to pay half of my portion on the day that the impression is made.`,

"Incision & Drainage": `My condition has been explained to me as an abscess—an advanced infection that has caused a localized collection of infected fluids. The primary treatment of an abscess is to drain the area, called "Incision and Drainage," to assist healing and to allow other treatment such as antibiotics, etc. to work better.

The procedure(s) necessary to treat my condition(s) has/have been explained to me and I understand the nature of the treatment to be:
I have been informed of possible alternate methods of treatment (if any) including: I understand that these other forms of treatment, or no treatment at all, are choices I have and the risks of those choices have been presented to me.

My doctor has explained to me that there are certain inherent and potential risks and side effects associated with my proposed treatment and, in this specific instance, they include, but are not limited to:
* Post-operative discomfort and swelling that may require several days of at-home recovery
* Infections are often difficult to cure and may require additional (sometimes complex and prolonged) treatment even after the incision and drainage procedure
* Prolonged or heavy bleeding that may require additional treatment
* Injury or damage to structures or tissues (blood vessels, nerves, salivary glands or ducts, bone, etc.) that lie deep to the skin or gum/cheek mucosa and cannot be readily identified
* Injury to sensory nerves in the area (undetectable by any exact means) that may result in pain, numbness, tingling or other sensory disturbances in the chin, lip, cheek, teeth, gums or tongue (including possible loss of taste sensation), and which may persist for several weeks or months, or in rare cases, may be permanent
* More rarely, motor nerves in the area of the incision may be affected, which may result in diminished function of muscles of facial expression
* Placement of drains (rubber or fabric) that are often sutured in place and require removal after several days. Such drains may add to discomfort and interfere with normal function
* Stretching of the corners of the mouth that may cause cracking or bruising, and may heal slowly
* Allergic reactions (previously unknown) to any medications used in treatment
* Restricted mouth opening during healing, sometimes related to swelling and muscle soreness, and sometimes related to stress on the jaw joints (TMJ), especially when TMJ problems already exist
* If the approach to the abscess necessitates a skin incision, there will be some evidence of scarring that will be permanent. Such scarring may sometimes be repaired by additional plastic surgery

During the course of treatment unforeseen conditions may be revealed that may require changes in the procedure noted in paragraph 2 above. I authorize my doctor and staff to use professional judgment to perform such additional procedures that are necessary and desirable to complete my surgery.`,

"Local Anesthesia Consent": `Local Anesthesia Consent Form

Local anesthesia is an injection given in the mouth to dull pain in all or part of the mouth for dental work but does not put the patient to sleep.
Although the use of local anesthetics to control pain is a safe, well-established procedure, adverse reactions can occur. These reactions include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Fainting (vasovagal syncope) with or without a rapid pulse and lowered blood pressure. Usually associated with fear.

2. Rapid heartbeat (short term) can occur during the administration of local anesthesia. This is due to the epinephrine that is included in most anesthetics. Everybody has epinephrine in their body naturally—it is often referred to as adrenaline. However, it can make your heart feel like it is racing for a few minutes when the medication is first introduced into your body. If you already have high blood pressure, let the dentist know and an anesthetic can be used without epinephrine.

3. Hyperventilation syndrome is usually brought on by fear. It is characterized by tingling in the hands, lightheadedness and tightness in the chest.

4. Toxicity reactions initially appear as dizziness, blurred vision, or tremors and can proceed into drowsiness, convulsions, unconsciousness, or even respiratory or cardiac arrest. Toxicity reactions occur from an overdose or rapid absorption of the anesthetic into the bloodstream. Although we will never use more anesthetic than recommended for your body size, it is important to realize everybody has their own tolerance level. Please advise the doctor if you are more, or less, tolerant of medications in general.

5. Allergic reactions to today’s local anesthetics (lidocaine/septocaine/carbocaine/marcaine/citanest) are extremely rare. Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, edema/swelling, redness, and other manifestations of allergies. Anaphylactic reactions involving trouble breathing rarely happen but will require us to call 911 if they do occur to ensure your safety.

6. Idiosyncratic reactions of unexplained origin are exaggerated responses to an average dose of a drug. These reactions present clinically in a wide range of manifestations. Please inform the doctor if you have a history of severe reactions to medical treatment.

There are also several complications that can arise from the injection itself that you should be aware of:

1. “Numbness” to additional areas of the face can occur due to variations in nerve anatomy. For example, when we anesthetize the lower teeth, the nerve branches carry anesthetic to the lower lip and tongue as well as the teeth. Sometimes the anesthetic may be carried along other nerve branches as well, in turn numbing other areas of the face. Other common areas to receive anesthesia are the temples, eyelids, cheeks, and chin. Often, when the eyelids are anesthetized, the affected eye cannot close and will tear up. These areas will start to feel and react normally once the anesthesia wears off. Anesthesia typically lasts between 1 and 4 hours but varies for each individual.

2. Paresthesia may occur if the nerve trunk is traumatized by the needle during the injection of anesthesia. This results in a residual tingling sensation, or in partial numbness of the affected tissue. Although paresthesia following a lower injection usually presents as a residual tingle in the lower lip and tongue, it can also affect the eyelids, cheeks, and chin. The symptoms of paresthesia gradually diminish, and recovery is usually complete. It is important that you inform the dentist as soon as you experience symptoms of paresthesia so that you can undergo treatment right away if needed. Early treatment is essential for success in certain cases of paresthesia.

3. A quick feeling of “shock” can occur as the anesthetic is administered near the nerve. Often described as a feeling of electrical shock. This is normal and has no long-term effects.

4. Hematoma (swelling with bruising) can occur when a blood vessel is punctured during the injection. The released blood will pool under the influence of gravity and form a hematoma. Bruising may be visible for up to 2 weeks.

5. Trauma to lips and cheeks is a common complication of dental work—largely because when you are numb, you will not feel a bite injury as it occurs. Therefore, we recommend that you do not eat when you are numb. Also, your lips may become dry, chapped, and cracked as a result of your procedure today.

6. Recurrence of cold sores. This can only happen to those individuals who already carry the virus for cold sores. In between outbreaks, the Herpes virus that causes cold sores lies dormant within your nerves. Therefore, when the nerve is anesthetized, the virus may be triggered/awakened to form a new cold sore. Prescription medication can be taken prior to treatment to avoid a new outbreak.

7. Jaw pain often occurs for two reasons. One reason is that the muscles around the jaw may be traumatized by the injection of anesthesia. Another reason is muscle fatigue that results from holding your mouth in an open position for an extended time period.`,

"Nitrous Oxide Consent": `NITROUS OXIDE INFORMED CONSENT
I hereby authorize Todays Dentistry to perform nitrous oxide/oxygen conscious sedation for myself (or my child/ward):

1. I accept and understand that Nitrous Oxide is commonly called laughing gas and provides relaxation. I understand that I (or my child) will be awake and aware of my surroundings, and able to respond rationally to questions and directions.

2. I accept and understand that Nitrous Oxide is an elective procedure.

3. Nitrous oxide sedation is used for anxiety and pain control, as well as control of gagging. Local anesthesia will also be required.

4. I have been advised of the possible complications associated with Nitrous Oxide. They include, but are not limited to:
a) Nausea and vomiting: This is the most frequent of the side effects of nitrous oxide sedation but its frequency is still quite low.
b) Temporary tingling in the fingers, toes, cheeks, lips, tongue and head or neck area.
c) Temporary warm feeling throughout the body with accompanying flushing/blushing.
d) Temporary detachment or “out of body” sensation.
e) Temporary sluggishness in motion and/or speech.

5. Nitrous oxide sedation is very effective for many people, however; some people may not like the feeling it produces.

6. For some people nitrous oxide sedation may not calm them adequately to allow a dental procedure to be done. These people may require a different technique for tolerance of procedure.

I hereby certify that I understand this authorization and the reasons for the above named sedative procedure and its associated risks. I have read and understand the above and give my consent to surgery. I have given a complete and truthful medical history, including all medicines, drug use, pregnancy, etc. I certify that I speak, read and write English. All of my questions have been answered before signing this form.`,

"Oral Surgery Consent": `
The surgical procedure to be performed has been explained to me and I understand what is to be done. This is my consent to the surgery indicated on the surgery record. I agree to the use of local anesthesia and/or IV sedation, as previously discussed.

I have been informed and understand that occasionally there are complications of the surgery, drugs, and anesthesia. The more common complications are pain, infection, swelling, bleeding, dry sockets, bruising and discoloration, temporary numbness and tingling of the lip, tongue, chin, gums, cheek or teeth. The possibility of injury to or stiffness of the neck and facial muscles and also changes of the occlusion and tempro-mandibular joint (TMJ) have been explained. The doctor has discussed with me the possibility of injury to adjacent teeth, restorations in other teeth, or injury to other tissues, referred pain to the ear, neck and head, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, bone fractures, delayed healing and permanent numbness in nerves in the facial area. Sinus complications which may occur from the removal of upper teeth include a root tip or tooth in the sinus or an oro-antral fistula (opening into the sinus from the mouth) which would possibly require sinus treatments following the oral surgery. If there are additional costs for a sinus closure procedure, I understand the cost of the additional surgery will be at an additional cost to me. In rare cases if referral to a specialist is required, I understand that the fees for the specialist would be an additional cost to me.

Medications, drugs, anesthetics, and prescriptions may cause drowsiness and lack of awareness and coordination which could be increased by the use of alcohol or other drugs: thus, I have been advised not to operate any vehicle or hazardous devices, or work while taking such medications and/or drugs until fully recovered from the effects of above. I understand and agree not to operate any vehicle or hazardous devices for at least 24 hours or until fully recovered from the effects of the anesthetic, medication, and drugs that may have been given to me in the office for my care.

I acknowledge the receipt of and understand the postoperative instructions and have been given an appointment date to return. I understand I can ask for a full recital of any and all possible risks attendant to my care just by asking.

"Orthodontic Consent": `
ORTHODONTIC INFORMED CONSENT

The following information is routinely provided to anyone considering orthodontic treatment in our office. While recognizing the benefits of a pleasing smile and healthy teeth, you should also be aware that orthodontic treatment, just as any treatment of the body, has inherent risks and limitations. These potential complications are seldom sufficient to rule out treatment but should be considered when deciding whether to proceed. Please note that it is impossible to list every possible circumstance but the following represents our best estimate of the information you need.

ROOT RESORPTION – In a few cases, the ends of some of the teeth are shortened during treatment. In the event of subsequent gum disease, this shortening could reduce the longevity of affected teeth. Under healthy circumstances, the shortened teeth suffer no disadvantage.

DECALCIFICATION, DECAY OR GUM DISEASE – These problems may occur if the patient does not cooperate with proper brushing and flossing. Additionally, maintaining proper dietary control is essential, especially by minimizing the intake of sugar.

TREATMENT TIME – Our estimated treatment time is our best guess as to how long treatment will take. Progress can be delayed by abnormal facial growth, tooth moving mechanical difficulties, poor appliance wear cooperation, broken appliances and missed appointments.

DEVITALIZATION – It is possible for the nerve inside a tooth to die during treatment thus requiring a root canal on the affected tooth. The most common cause of this problem is that the tooth received some sort of trauma such as a blow or a large cavity sometime in the past.

TMJ PAIN – Some patients may develop jaw joint noises, discomfort and facial pain related to the jaw during or after treatment. The current belief is that these problems are caused more by habitual grinding of the teeth rather than the way in which the teeth bite. If such a problem arises, treatment by another specialist may be required.

INJURY FROM APPLIANCES – Some orthodontic appliances, such as a headgear, can be injurious. If any appliances we consider being potentially injurious are prescribed, we will be sure to inform you of this potential and will expect our instructions to be followed carefully.

RETURN OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM – We intend to obtain the best result possible. Some orthodontic problems, however, tend to return to their original condition to a small degree. Careful cooperation during the retention phase of treatment will keep this relapse to a minimum.

ADDITIONAL TREATMENT – Unforeseen circumstances (such as abnormal growth or gum disease) may cause us to recommend a form of additional treatment not previously discussed. If this occurs, we will carefully explain the reasons for a change in the treatment plan and any extra fees before proceeding.

CONSENT TO USE RECORDS – I hereby give my permission for the use of orthodontic records, including photographs for purposes of professional consultations, research, education or publication in professional journals.

LIMITATIONS TO ACHIEVING TREATMENT GOALS – Even when an ideal treatment plan is chosen, certain limitations will exist to the achieving of the desired treatment goals. We will provide you with a list of the potential limitations to achieving an ideal result, and ask that you read the information carefully before consenting to orthodontic treatment.

OTHER INFORMATION – The following information is also important for your understanding of our recommended treatment, and your responsibilities for achieving the desired results.

APPOINTMENT POLICIES – The normal interval between appointments is 4–6 weeks. Our appointment policy is to schedule longer procedures, and those that require major adjustments earlier in the day. These include archwire changes, major archwire adjustments, banding and bonding of the braces to the teeth, and removing the braces. These appointments require very precise adjustments of bands, brackets, archwires, or removable appliances. The intricate nature of the work necessitates that they be done during less busy times. By reserving our after work and after school appointments for shorter visits and those that require only minor adjustments, we can accommodate more people during these times.

We will do our best to accommodate each family with appointments that do not conflict with work or school. However, if we feel that the quality of our treatment suffers, or that treatment time is being unduly extended, we will have to insist that our scheduling requirements be followed. We ask that you alternate after school appointments to give every patient access to these times. We try to do as much as possible at each appointment to assure that fewer appointments will be needed and that overall treatment time will be within the estimate given at the beginning of treatment. This way the total amount of time invested in orthodontic treatment can be kept to a minimum.

MISSED APPOINTMENT POLICY – Appointments are scheduled at intervals for best treatment progress. Missed appointments or repeated lateness prolongs treatment. A missed appointment fee of $50 will be charged for appointments missed or not cancelled with 24 hours. We will try to confirm your appointments 1–2 days in advance, but we will not always have time to do so. It is your responsibility to remember your appointments. If an appointment is canceled less than 24 hours in advance, it is considered missed. Likewise, if you arrive late for your appointment, we may have to reschedule to another time and it will be treated as a missed appointment. Our most favorable times for appointments are after school/after work hours; if you miss your appointment during these times, you will be asked to reschedule during morning hours.

TRANSFER POLICY – In the event a patient transfers from the practice prior to the end of treatment, the treatment fee will be adjusted for services rendered to date. The treatment fee to date will be determined according to our standard banding fee and monthly payment schedule, regardless of the individual payment plan. We are required to maintain all original records once treatment has been started; therefore, we must charge a fee for duplicating your records and transferring them to your new orthodontist. Records will not be transferred prior to account settlement.

EXCESSIVE APPLIANCE BREAKAGE – If the patient has a loose band or bracket or a broken appliance, we ask that you contact our office as soon as possible so the appropriate appointment can be scheduled. If you already have an appointment scheduled, please let us know so we can determine if there is ample time for the repair. Our goal is to repair broken appliances without necessitating an additional visit. Broken brackets will result in a $25 fee (per bracket) after the third breakage.

EXTENDED TREATMENT POLICY – In the event that treatment time is extended beyond the originally estimated time frame due to poor compliance (missed appointments, excessive appliance breakage, poor elastic or headgear wear, or prolonged poor oral hygiene), monthly fees will resume until treatment is complete. Our policy is to charge 60% of our normal monthly fee to cover the cost of continuation of treatment. In this manner, the responsible party and our office “share” the cost of the additional treatment. Hopefully, a timely completion will be reached. You will always have the option of discontinuing treatment and accepting a compromised result if you choose not to pay the additional charges.

By my signature below I acknowledge that I have read the ORTHODONTIC INFORMED CONSENT and may receive a copy of the form at my request.
