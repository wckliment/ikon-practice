  "Extraction Consent": `
Extraction(s) are to be performed on the tooth/teeth listed above. While we expect no complications, there are some risks involved with this procedure. The more common complications are:

- Pain, infection, swelling, bruising, and discoloration. Adjacent teeth may be chipped or damaged during the extraction.

- Nerves that run near the area of extraction may be bruised or damaged. You may experience some temporary numbness and tingling of the lip and chin, or in rare cases, the tongue. In some extremely rare instances, the lack of sensation could be permanent.

- In the upper arch, sinus complications can occur because the roots of some upper teeth extend near or into the sinuses. After extraction, a hole may be present between the sinus and the mouth. If this happens, you will be informed and the area repaired.

By signing below you acknowledge that you understand the information presented, have had all your questions answered satisfactorily, and give consent to perform this procedure.

"Denture/Partial Repair Consent": `I understand that the repair that is being done to my existing Partial denture today and can not be guaranteed due to missing teeth in the existing dentition and due to the age of the existing prosthesis. This repair may or may not be temporary.

If I am having a relign or rebase of an old Denture or Partial I understand that Today’s Dentistry is not responsible for changes in the fit of the original appliance. The prosthesis may or may NOT fit as the original did years ago or when I originally had it made. The reason is that over time, the patient’s bone shrinks or deteriorates and a rebase or relign is a secondary option to dental implants or a new prosthesis with soft tissue management.

We will do our best to make the patient comfortable but sometimes there are limitations due to bone shrinkage and the soft tissue that lacks bone support. Therefore, after the relign or rebase the patient will be entitled to two free adjustments within a month period. After this the patient will have to pay for any and all adjustments.
`,

"Implant Consent": `There are no instances, which has been reported in the dental literature in which dental implants have ever been reported as being the cause of cancer.

HOW IS AN IMPLANT INSERTED?
Although there are many types of implants, the types can be divided into two basic groups -- those that are inserted in the bone, and those that are placed over the bone. In both instances, the implants are placed under the tissue, and extend through the tissue into the mouth. Most implants require soft tissue grafting to improve the prognosis of the implants.

DECISIONS AND LENGTH OF TREATMENT TIME
If you have decided that you want to be considered as an implant candidate, and you feel that psychologically it will be no emotional problem for you to have implants, then you can be encouraged from the fact that there are many people in this country and throughout the world who have had hip transplants, pins placed in the hips, kidney and heart transplants, and cornea transplants with excellent results. If you do not feel that you have adequate emotional stability to undergo similar treatment, then I would advise you against having an implant. Implant treatment in some cases can be a lengthy process. It may involve Bone Grafting in which the bone must knit or grow for four to nine months and occasionally longer. After your doctor has determined that the bone is ready for implant placement, it will take six to nine months to become firmly attached to the bone before fixed teeth can be attached to the implants.

GUARANTEE
There is no way that we can guarantee anything which goes into the mouth, and which is under the control of the patient. The physician does not tell you that the transplanted heart, the kidney transplant, or the coronary by-pass will keep you alive for any specified period of time. We can only tell you that we will endeavor to place the implant properly, will give you the information you need to help care for your implant at home, and will be available for regular periodic check-up appointments to evaluate your continued dental health.
We will do everything we can to make the implant succeed, but you will have to make the same commitment. If you do not hold up your end of the bargain, the implant will most likely fail. Also, you must return to our office at regular intervals according to our recommendations for examination and service.
If you do not do this, you could get into difficulty without your knowing it. This could result in the loss of the implant. Under such circumstances, the fault would be yours. Due to the complex nature of Oral Implantology, it is important that this office handle all postoperative examinations and/or treatment. Referrals will be made only to those doctors with experience and training in implant dentistry.

COSMETIC SURGERY
Are dental implants inserted for cosmetics reasons? Absolutely not! The primary objective of dental implants is to give additional support to the replacement teeth.

Dental Implantology is not a total substitute for facelift plastic surgery. Some cosmetic enhancement is possible, however, and those expectations should be fully discussed prior to treatment.

COMPLICATIONS - Some patients have little or no problems at all. Some have bruising, swelling and discomfort.

FURTHER QUESTIONS
If you have any questions, which have not been fully answered by this monograph, please feel free to ask them prior to beginning treatment. We will do our best to inform you.

"Filling Consent": `
A thin, white, sticky film called plaque causes tooth decay.  Plaque constantly accumulates on your teeth and contains harmful bacteria.  When the plaque is combined with sugars from the foods we eat, it forms an acid.  The decay process begins when this acid attacks the tooth enamel (1).  If the decay is not treated early, the cavity will rapidly progress toward the pulp (2) in the central part of the tooth.  Discomfort may result because the pulp contains the nerve of the tooth.  If the decay continues into the pulp, infection may set in.

X-rays are used to detect hidden areas of tooth decay and possible decay between your teeth.  To repair the decayed teeth, your dentist will clean out the decayed area and fill it with filling material (3).  The proper and most inexpensive approach to tooth decay is its prevention, early detection and treatment.

X-rays are two-dimensional and sometimes do not show the full extent of the decay present.  Sometimes, it is not known until the dentist removes the decay how far into the dentin the decay traveled and if it has entered the nerve canal.  Also, sometimes after a filling has been done, if the decay is close to the nerve the tooth may be sensitive for several weeks.  Most of the time the sensitivity subsides, however, in some instances filled teeth may require root canal therapy. Also, if the filling falls out due to the patient having a collapsed bite, it is not considered under warranty, and the patient is responsible for the full cost of redoing the filling. If insurance paid for the original filling and it fails due to collapsed bite, patient is responsible for 100% of the cost of redoing it, as insurance will not pay for it again.
`,

  "Crown/Bridge Consent": `
1. I understand that the first appointment is for preparing the crown of the tooth to the proper shape and size for the permanent crown. I understand that the tooth will be covered with a temporary crown for at least three to four weeks during the time that the dental laboratory is fabricating the permanent crown.

2. I understand that I am responsible for making sure that I come in immediately if the temporary crown comes off or breaks during this three to four week period. I understand that the teeth can shift in a very short period of time (sometimes overnight) and that if the temporary comes out, that the permanent crown or crowns/bridges may not fit and may need to be remade by the dental lab, in which I would be responsible for partial or full cost replacement crown.

3. I understand that coming in for the permanent seat of the permanent crown is necessary within a three to four week period and that if I cannot keep my appointment for the permanent seat, that I could be responsible for the full payment of another crown if I do not keep my follow-up seat appointment.

4. In addition, I understand that the permanent crown is sometimes seated with temporary cement so that the patient can see if the fit is going comfortable and pain free. I am responsible for keeping my appointment for the permanent cementation and that if I do not keep this appointment, I am responsible for the cost of tooth repair at a later time.

5. I understand that front teeth MAY have a custom shading charge if I am not happy with the shade, as front teeth are extremely hard to match exactly. Each appointment for custom shading will be charged until the patient and Doctor are happy. (Insurance does not cover this as this is considered cosmetic.)

6. I understand that crown and bridge is a biological procedure and there is no guarantee that capping a tooth will prevent the patient from future pain, tooth repair or loss. Capping a tooth most often protects the tooth after a root canal from cracking and in addition, most often helps in providing a protective barrier when the tooth structure is damaged or cracked. However, I understand that nerve tissue is involved and that the nerve is sometimes hypersensitive to hot and/or cold and percussion, and that sometimes a tooth is irreparable after crown preparation procedures. I understand that in some cases a root canal may still be needed AFTER crown preparation procedure. I understand that placement of a crown is an attempt at fixing tooth structure but that if the tooth cannot be saved after placement of a crown, I am still responsible for full payment of the crown and bridge. I understand that once a tooth is prepared for a crown and an impression is sent to the lab, this crown is custom made for me and there will be no refund after acceptance of the consent and after impression is made even if the crown is not seated. I also understand that if I am missing any teeth, this is considered a "Collapsed Bite" and this could potentially affect the longevity of the crown. The molars, or implants in the molar's place, are the support system needed to sustain long term restoration.

7. I have requested Today's Dentistry to place crown and bridge on my teeth/tooth I understand that if I have dental insurance, Crown Lengthening (Gingivectomy) is at most times NOT covered by insurance. I understand that the Dentist has determined that the decay is below the gum-line or at bone level therefore, tissue must be removed using a dental laser, electrosurge or surgical bur, in order to expose healthy tooth structure and provide the best possible crown margin.

8. I understand that if I am using dental insurance, sometimes my insurance may pay less on a crown due to clauses in my policy and I am responsible for the difference.

9. I understand that sometimes insurance may need additional time processing the claim even if the crown is ready to be seated and I may be called and offered the option of rescheduling my crown seat until insurance pays or I may pay the account balance, have the crown seated, and be refunded once insurance pays. BUT, I also understand that if I choose to wait and the temporary comes off, I am responsible if the remaining tooth structure is damaged by my decision to wait.
`,

  "Apicoectomy Consent": `
I understand dentistry is not an exact science and there is no guarantee of results. When undergoing an Apicoectomy there are certain risks and the potential for unsuccessful results. An Apicoectomy is a common endodontic treatment which is necessitated in the rare instance there is inflammation or infection at the tip of the root subsequent to root canal therapy. An incision is made in the gum tissue near the affected tooth and the inflamed or infected tissue is removed and the area filled and sealed. The gum is then sutured with small stitches. Additional tests may be performed on the infected/inflamed tissue which was removed.

The benefit of an Apicoectomy will be relief of current symptoms and avoiding the spread of infection to other teeth, damaging oral health.

Alternatives to an Apicoectomy depend on the diagnosis; however, the most common alternatives are:
• Extraction of the tooth/teeth;
• Extraction followed by an implant and crown;
• Extraction followed by a bridge or partial denture;
• No treatment, which could worsen the condition leading to severe pain and swelling, infection which could be fatal, and/or loss of the tooth/teeth.

An Apicoectomy, like all dental care, has risks. The most common risks associated with this treatment include but are not limited to:
• Swelling, bruising and discomfort postoperatively
• Bleeding and postoperative infection accompanied by malaise or fever which may require immediate additional treatment
• Injury to a nerve resulting in numbness, burning or tingling of the chin, lip, cheek, or gum on the side the procedure is being performed, as well as loss of taste in the tongue; these nerve injuries can last for several weeks, months or be permanent
• Drug and medication reactions (e.g., redness, pain, vomiting, anaphylactic shock)
• Sinus involvement which may require additional surgery
• Gum recession exposing more of the tooth/root

Prior to surgery, an antibiotic or anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed. Note: antibiotics may interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use alternate birth control for one full cycle post-antibiotics.

Additional appointments may be required after surgery to monitor healing.

By signing below, I confirm I have read or had this document read to me, have asked any questions and received answers. I understand the potential risks and have chosen to proceed with treatment having considered alternatives.
